**Salva** is primarily being maintained and developed by [Dimforge](https://dimforge.org),
and welcomes contributions from the community. In this page you will see various ways of getting
help and contributing.

## Let's talk
You are encouraged to join us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vt9DJSW)! We are
always happy to help, and sometimes a single question there could save you loads of time
skimming through the documentation.

## Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if you're stuck with a specific error. Read through the
[existing questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/salva) tagged with **salva** or
[ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=salva)!

## Working on this website

You can contribute to this website by completing, improving, and correcting
it. Do not hesitate to correct even the smallest, insignificant detail
(especially English mistakes, including typography). We love nitpicking!  This
website is composed of a set of markdown files located on the
[salva.rs](https://github.com/dimforge/salva.rs) repository. It is compiled using
[Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io). As explained in the next section,
you need to fork, fix, and create a pull request targeting the **master**
branch of the **salva.rs** repository to make your contribution ready
to integrate into our code base. There are no specific rules, except that all
compilable code to generate illustrations
must be located on the `src` folder.  Downloadable examples have to be located
on the `examples` directory of the main project [repository](https://github.com/dimforge/salva).


## Working on the library

If you intend to work on the source code of **Salva**, you should start by
[forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the
[repository](https://github.com/dimforge/salva). Once you are done making
modifications to your own copy of **Salva**, you have to [create a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) targeting
the **dev** branch so that your contribution can be reviewed, commented, and
eventually merged.
